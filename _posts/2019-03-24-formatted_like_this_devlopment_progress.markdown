Growing up I was convinced that my path was space. From the time that I was 7, I crafted out a meticulous plan on how I was going to achieve this goal. Crafting the life that I hoped to live and continuing to work towards that final goal. During my time at a university all of the those plans came crashing down. With year that I worked towards this goal, none of it made sense to me anymore. It got to the point where I was going through the  motions of the plan without the want and desire to actually get there. 

I sunk into depression and dropped out. Going home with nothing but fear of the future. I worked, refreshed and started planning again. Test after test, I did whatever I could to find out what I was good at. Sifting through the lists of projected careers for my suited for my personality, I visualized myself in them all. But I thought to myself, where would I fit the most? What would make me the happiest? What type of job could I find that not only challenged me, but also made me want to get up everyday? 

That's when it hit me. I would be a developer. I had always been fascinated by what was under the hood of technology, being a developer would then mean that I would be apart of what goes into that tech. I couldn't think of anything that sounded better. 

From that day forward I started planning, went back to school, finished my business degree while working two jobs and started to teach myself how to code. I spent endless hours working and developing whatever skills possible to get me to this point. 

My journey is far from over.
